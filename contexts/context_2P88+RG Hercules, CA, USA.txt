### History
The City of Hercules has a unique history that has transformed it from a small company town to a bustling community. The Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s significantly changed business across the United States, and California Powder Works was a key player in this transformation. The company produced black powder, primarily for firearms, opening its first plant in Santa Cruz in 1861 and a second plant near Golden Gate Park in 1869. As San Francisco's population grew, the company sought a rural location to accommodate the production of explosive materials.

In 1879, California Powder Works established a new facility in Hercules, which began operating in 1881 and produced dynamite. By 1913, the workforce from the Santa Cruz plant was transitioned to Hercules, expanding production to include black powder. The town was formally incorporated on December 15, 1900, as the management sought more autonomy from local authorities to ensure the plant's success. The first city council was composed of plant managers, and the regulations they established primarily focused on supporting the business that bore the city's name.

### Architecture
Hercules has evolved into a suburban, family-oriented community with plans for a new town center and waterfront, as well as a train and ferry terminal. The city has embraced smart growth principles to promote a transit-oriented community, which is evident in the development of live/work buildings in the Promenade and Bayside neighborhoods as part of the Central Hercules Plan. 

Current urban planning emphasizes maintaining the unique historical character of Hercules while supporting ongoing growth, with community services including parks and recreational programs. Hercules boasts several parks, including Refugio Valley Park, which encompasses 66 acres and features a community swim center. Approximately one-third of the city's land area is dedicated to parks and open space, providing residents with access to nature and recreational opportunities. Future plans also include redeveloping historic areas into public parks, reflecting the cityâ€™s commitment to preserving its heritage amidst modern development.
