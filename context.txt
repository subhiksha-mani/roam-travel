Meiji Jingu, established in 1920, is a modern shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. The original building was destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt and restored in 1958. Located beside the busy Harajuku Station, Meiji Shrine is surrounded by a large forested area that includes walking paths for visitors to enjoy a tranquil escape from the city.

The shrine complex features a massive torii gate marking the entrance, leading visitors into a peaceful forest comprising approximately 100,000 trees, donated from various regions of Japan during the shrine's construction. Meiji Jingu is known for its traditional Shinto activities such as making offerings and writing wishes on ema. It attracts more than three million visitors during the New Year for hatsumode, making it one of the most visited shrines in Japan.

Adjacent to the shrine is the Meiji Jingu Museum, which opened in 2019, displaying treasures from the shrine's collection, including personal belongings of the emperor and empress. The Inner Garden, which requires an entrance fee, becomes especially popular in mid-June when irises bloom. 

Meiji Jingu is open daily, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the serene environment while exploring its rich history and cultural significance.
